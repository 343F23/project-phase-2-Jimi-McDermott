            "bio": "I&#x27;m Jimi, a senior computer science student at JMU, and it&#x27;s safe to say I have an abundance of hobbies that keep life interesting. One of my greatest passions is film photography, where I find joy in capturing moments through the lens of an analog camera, developing film, and cherishing the timeless quality of each photograph.When I&#x27;m not behind the camera, you can often find me hanging out with my friends, creating unforgettable memories and sharing laughter. My love for programming is another significant aspect of my life; I&#x27;m always eager to dive into new projects and explore the endless possibilities of code. Beyond my academic pursuits and hobbies, I&#x27;m an active member of several organizations on campus, including Lambda Phi Epsilon, the Vietnamese Student Association, and the Filipino Americans at Madison. These groups have not only provided me with a sense of belonging but have also allowed me to engage with diverse communities and develop meaningful connections. As a senior, I&#x27;m excited to make the most of my remaining time at JMU while continuing to explore and embrace the rich tapestry of experiences that college life has to offer.",
