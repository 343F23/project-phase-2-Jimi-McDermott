  <li>Report.html is here!</li>
  <li>5 Meaningful pages = [index = Homepage], [about = Profile], [blog = Search], [jimis-profile = one example page], [jacksons-profile = another example page]</li>
  <li>Each page has a consistant header.</li>
  <li>Each header contains navigation links to each page.</li>
  <li>Each page scales for different sized screens. Used resources from class, reddit, and various other websites.</li>
  <li>Images are included on different pages</li>
  <li>The only issues given are contrast issues, but left for aesthetic purposes, wasnt sure the ruling on this.</li>
  <li>More than 2 fonts are used Montserrat, Inconsolata, Roboto.</li>
  <li>Two forms, Search and a review form. Both static/non-functional.</li>
  <li>No Current links to other websites, have placeholder buttons for twitter, facebook, and email.</li>
  <li>API used for fonts, didnt know this was not neccisary for the first push.  The opther API i am thinking of is to scan reviews for hatespeech.</li>
  <li>Other notes:
    I used Normalize.css. Found it on reddit, not completely sure how it works but seriously helped with the scaling on browsers because I was having trouble working on this between 
    my laptop and PC.</li>
